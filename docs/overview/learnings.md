# Learnings

Non-obvious lessons discovered while building.

## Always have working software and working docs

Documentation must never outrun what actually works. The README is specced **first** (0001)
and every subsequent spec carries a "README updated" acceptance item, so docs and software
advance together. Forward-looking examples are allowed only when clearly labelled _(planned)_
— never presented as if they work today.

**Apply it:** when a build adds real capability, update the README (and these living docs) in
the same change to match reality. Don't leave aspirational snippets unmarked.

## pnpm 11 build approval lives in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, not `package.json`

pnpm 11 blocks dependency build scripts (esbuild, style-dictionary, …) until approved, and
on each install it **rewrites `pnpm-workspace.yaml`** to inject an `allowBuilds:` block with
placeholder string values (`set this to true or false`). The fix is to set those values to
boolean `true` in that file. The old `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` field in `package.json` is
**ignored** in pnpm 11 (it warns and drops it). Symptom if unresolved: `style-dictionary
build` fails because pnpm's pre-run dep check (`pnpm install`) exits non-zero on every build.

## Token-build formats must honor references, and seams need exercising input

Custom Style Dictionary formats that emit a token's resolved `$value` silently flatten token
*references* — only the built-in `css/variables` preserves them (via `outputReferences`).
With a single flat sample token this looks fine and ships green; it would first break in 0004
when semantic→primitive references and the `.dark` remap arrive — the exact theming seam the
skeleton exists to prove. Fix: reference-aware custom formats, with `tokens.css` as the single
owner of runtime `:root` vars and the Tailwind preset using `@theme inline` to reference them.
See [`docs/feedback/0001-token-reference-seam.md`](../feedback/0001-token-reference-seam.md).

**Apply it:** never prove a seam with degenerate input (a flat token, an empty list). Use
input that actually exercises the mechanism — here, a token that references another — and add
a test that asserts the mechanism survives into every generated output.

## Storybook under pnpm needs a hoist pattern

Storybook's preset loader resolves modules (e.g. `@storybook/react-vite/preset`) from the
project root, which breaks under pnpm's isolated node_modules — `storybook build` dies with
`Cannot find module '@storybook/react-vite/preset'`. Fix: add `.npmrc` with
`public-hoist-pattern[]=*storybook*` (and `@storybook/*`) so Storybook packages are hoisted
where the loader looks.
